# Hi, I'm Hal 👋
## Data Engineer | Problem Solver | Life Liver

🧠 I'm a London-based data engineer who wrangles Python, SQL, Spark, and Databricks by day — and chases meaning in everything else by night.

🛠️ I love building reliable, scalable data pipelines that actually make sense to the people using them. I believe in clean architecture, purposeful work, and asking why before how.

🌱 Outside the code, you’ll find me deep in a novel or chasing my dog through Richmond Park.
